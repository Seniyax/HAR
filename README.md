# Human Activity Recognition using Deep learning
## Overview
**Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** refers to the process of identifying and classifying human actions and behaviors based on sensor data.This project implements deep learning methods to classify human actions based on sensor data (UCL HAR dataset).
## Actvities classified
 - **Walking**
 - **Walking Upstairs**
 - **Sitting**
 - **Standing**
 - **Laying**

Used both processed feature extracted data and unprocessed raw data to train two models ( FCN for processed biLSTM with attention for raw ) to classify above activities. both models perform well.
